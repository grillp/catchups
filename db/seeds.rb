This is our regular catch-up, but in a slightly different format.

As before, I would like to discuss:
- Your current pain points with our development process
- Opportunities and ideas for improving our development process
- Your development as software craftsman

In this new format, each regular catch-up will involve a different set of colleagues.

I'm hoping this will help create new relationships between our teams/streams, help with information flow and allow surfacing more opportunities for improvements.

Meanwhile, please don't hesitate to schedule 1:1 time with me (or just come have a chat) if there's anything you'd like to discuss privately.

Cheers,
Tal
